  "Strategy implementations for determining client IP addresses.

  This namespace provides various strategy implementations for extracting the
  real client IP from HTTP headers and connection information.

  Each strategy is designed for specific network configurations:

  * `RemoteAddrStrategy` - Direct connections (no reverse proxy)
  * `SingleIPHeaderStrategy` - Single trusted reverse proxy with single IP headers
  * `RightmostNonPrivateStrategy` - Multiple proxies, all with private IPs
  * `LeftmostNonPrivateStrategy` - Get IP closest to original client (not secure)
  * `RightmostTrustedCountStrategy` - Fixed number of trusted proxies
  * `RightmostTrustedRangeStrategy` - Known trusted proxy IP ranges
  * `ChainStrategy` - Try multiple strategies in order

  Strategies are created once and reused across requests. They are thread-safe
  and designed to fail fast on configuration errors while being resilient to
  malformed input during request processing."
